Camera is an extension that allows the Stage view to move around, rotate, and zoom.

:::warning
As of now, the Camera extension does not work consistently with Interpolation enabled. This is a known bug and we are trying our best to fix it.
It is recommended to disable interpolation if you plan on using this extension.
