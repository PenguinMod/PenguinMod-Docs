Using the keyboard or mouse, you can do a lot of actions quickly using key and mouse button combinations.

## Code Editor
With the **Duplicate script with Alt key** Editor Addon (enabled by default):
- Holding `Alt` while dragging a block or block stack will duplicate the block(s).
- Holding `Alt + Ctrl` while dragging a block inside a block stack will duplicate the block that was dragged, instead of the entire stack.
:::note
On macOS, use the Option key instead of the Alt key and Command key instead of the Control key.
:::

With the **Grab single block with Ctrl key** Editor Addon (enabled by default):
- Holding `Ctrl` while dragging a block inside a block stack will pull out individual blocks in the stack, rather than dragging the whole stack.
:::note
On macOS, use the Cmd key instead of the Ctrl key.
If "flip controls" is enabled on this addon in the Addons Menu, actions will swap and holding Ctrl will drag the whole stack instead.
:::

With the **Insert blocks by name** Editor Addon (enabled by default):
- Pressing `Ctrl + Space`, `Shift + Click`, or clicking with the middle mouse button on an empty part of the Workspace will open a menu to search for blocks by name.
